            <p> 
                Welcome to REform, a tool powered by RERUM.  REform seeks to allow users to structure data linked open data.  
                RERUM works with <a target="_blank" href="https://iiif.io/api/presentation/3.0/">manifests</a> to achieve this goal.
                By providing a manifest URL below, you can begin to structure the data in scope of the manifests.  If it a RERUM
                manifest that you own, you will be able to update the manifest directly.  If not, RERUM will offer you the chance to
                save a copy under your name.  
            </p>
            <p>
                REform also works with the <a target="_blank" href="http://inbox-docs.rerum.io">RERUM Inbox</a>.  If you do not wish to alter the manifest you are working with, you can choose
                to have RERUM inbox announce to the manifest that there are changes.  The new structure will be preserved and can be taken from
                RERUM inbox at any time.  The owner of the manifest can choose whether or not to absorb the announcement. 
            </p>
            <div id="reformManifest"> 
                Enter a manifest URL to create a table of contents for the canvases contained within it. 
                If there are existing table of contents for the manifest, we will offer the chance to load them for editing.
